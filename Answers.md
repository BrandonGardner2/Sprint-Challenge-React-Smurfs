1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

- Server-side routing is the more traditional way of providing web page content to users. It works in a method that when you attempt to go to a new page, the server is contacted again. The server will then have you download the content that is required to view the page and you will see a screen refresh with the new information.
- Client-side routing can be a much smoother experience for the end user. While you do initially have to download all of the data for a website, you will experience page transitions much faster and without a refresh effect.
